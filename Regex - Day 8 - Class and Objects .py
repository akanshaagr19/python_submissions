# multiple #multilevel inheritance 
# Inheritance is a mechanism that allows you to create a hierarchy of classes that share a set of properties and methods by 
# deriving a class from another class. Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties 
# from another class. 

#Benefits of inheritance are:

#Inheritance allows to inherit the properties of a class, i.e., base class to another, i.e., derived class. The benefits of
#Inheritance in Python are as follows:

# # It represents real-world relationships well.
# # It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add 
# # more features to a class without modifying it.
# # It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of 
# # B would automatically inherit from class A.
# # Inheritance offers a simple, understandable model structure. Less development and maintenance expenses result from
# # an inheritance. type of inheritance.

# There are 5 different types of inheritance in Python. They are as follows:

# Single inheritance: When a child class inherits from only one parent class, it is called single inheritance. We saw an 
# example above.
# Multiple inheritances: When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes, it is called multiple inheritances. 
# Multilevel inheritance: When we have a child and grandchild relationship. This means that a child class will inherit from 
# its parent class, which in turn is inheriting from its parent class.
# Hierarchical inheritance More than one derived class can be created from a single base.
# Hybrid inheritance: This form combines more than one form of inheritance. Basically, it is a blend of more than one 
# type of inheritance.
